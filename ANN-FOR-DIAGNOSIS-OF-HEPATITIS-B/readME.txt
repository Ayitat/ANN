Hepatitis Diagnostic System

This CD contains the following items:

1. Documentation
	It contains a summary of what the system is all about and the guidlines on how to use it.

2. Source code 
	It contains all the source code that means all the java files.
   How to use it?
   Install Netbeans IDE and java 6.0 or Higher version on Windows 7 or higher versions, after the 
   installation start netbeans and go to File Menu and open project and navigate to Source Code
   Netbeans folder to import all files and after that in the library add all the jar files needed 
   and run the project providing cs414 as username and 123 as password.

3. ANN model
	It is the artifical neural network model built and imported into the system.
   The ANN model is a feed forward backpropagation artifivial neural network and it was built using 
   neurophStudio which is an ANN framework that is based on java.

4. DataSet
	This is the dataset used in training , testing and validating the ANN model.
   The hepatitis dataset is gotten online from the UCI machine learning repository which is free. This
   dataset is then divided into training set and testing set.

5. Database
	It contains all the patients' record diagnosed by the system for future references by the medical 
   doctor.

For future work, the system will be modified for the diagnosis of other forms of hepatitis virus using ANN 
and other machine learning methods.
Live data from hospital records will be used instead of the UCI dataset to get a more realistic feeling.
